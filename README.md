extracting text from an image using tess4j to perform OCR in java

We need to add external jar files before we begin to code. I created this project in Eclipse IDE so I added the jar files by clicking on to the properties and then selected the 'Add external jar files'. After that you need to navigate to the location where your Tess4J file resides and then select the neccessary jar files. When you are done with adding all the jar files perfectly you can move on to the coding part. This is quite easy and simple to understand as most of the complicated functions are handled by the library methods.

The list of jar files to be included are
tess4j-3.4.8.jar
commoms-io-2.6.jar
jai-imageio-core-1.4.0.jar
jna-4.1.0.jar
jul-to-slf4j-1.7.25.jar
lept4j-1.6.4.jar
logback-classic-1.2.3.jar
logback-core-1.2.3.jar
slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar
